# game-of-life-rtos
A real time implementation of Conway's Game of Life, that responds to user inputs.

As this is a school project and some of the files used in the course are the property of the professor, only the code written by me is included in this repo. 

In isolation, this code will not run. Though if you want, it dhould be possible to adopt this to your own hardware.
